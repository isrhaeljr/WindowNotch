# My experience 

I like having more than one virtual desktop, specially when I'm programming, for example, having testing proyect and production in different desktop.  But either windows and an external apps gave me a fast option to know in which desktop I am. So I started thinking about a solution to this and when I thought about making a proyect in WPF this Idea came to my mind.

# How to use

You can run the app in each desktop you have opened and modify the notch in each them. If you want to close the notch in the specific desktop just press exit button.
